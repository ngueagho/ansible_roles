6 configurations of roles resolving problems type enterprise 



Configuration 1: Web Server Deployment with Load Balancer
Scenario:

Your enterprise needs to deploy a highly available web server cluster behind a load balancer. The environment consists of multiple web servers running Nginx, and a load balancer using HAProxy. The configuration needs to ensure that the web servers are correctly set up and that the load balancer is distributing traffic evenly.
Tasks:

    Create a nginx role:
        Install Nginx on the web servers.
        Deploy a custom Nginx configuration file using a template.
        Ensure the Nginx service is enabled and started.

    Create a haproxy role:
        Install HAProxy on the load balancer.
        Deploy a custom HAProxy configuration file that balances traffic between all Nginx servers.
        Ensure the HAProxy service is enabled and started.

    Create a playbook that uses the nginx and haproxy roles to deploy the web server cluster and load balancer.

Goals:

    Ensure all web servers are reachable through the load balancer.
    Test the configuration by scaling the number of web servers and verifying that the load balancer adjusts accordingly.

Configuration 2: Multi-Tier Application Deployment
Scenario:

Your organization needs to deploy a multi-tier application consisting of a database server (MySQL), an application server (Tomcat), and a web server (Apache). Each tier needs to be configured independently, and the components should communicate with each other.
Tasks:

    Create a mysql role:
        Install MySQL on the database server.
        Configure MySQL with a secure root password and create a database for the application.

    Create a tomcat role:
        Install Tomcat on the application server.
        Deploy the application WAR file to Tomcat using the files/ directory.
        Configure Tomcat to connect to the MySQL database.

    Create an apache role:
        Install Apache on the web server.
        Configure Apache to serve as a reverse proxy for the Tomcat server.

    Create a playbook that uses the mysql, tomcat, and apache roles to deploy the entire application stack.

Goals:

    Verify that the application is accessible via the web server.
    Ensure that the Tomcat server can communicate with the MySQL database.

Configuration 3: Centralized Logging with ELK Stack
Scenario:

Your enterprise wants to implement centralized logging using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to aggregate logs from multiple servers. The logs should be forwarded from web servers and application servers to a central logging server.
Tasks:

    Create an elasticsearch role:
        Install Elasticsearch on the logging server.
        Configure Elasticsearch to store logs.

    Create a logstash role:
        Install Logstash on the logging server.
        Configure Logstash to receive logs from the servers and forward them to Elasticsearch.

    Create a kibana role:
        Install Kibana on the logging server.
        Configure Kibana to visualize logs stored in Elasticsearch.

    Create a filebeat role:
        Install Filebeat on the web and application servers.
        Configure Filebeat to forward logs to the Logstash server.

    Create a playbook that deploys the ELK stack on the logging server and configures log forwarding from the web and application servers.

Goals:

    Ensure that logs from the web and application servers are visible in Kibana.
    Verify that Elasticsearch is indexing logs correctly.

Configuration 4: Automated Security Patch Management
Scenario:

Your enterprise needs to automate the process of applying security patches to all servers. The process should ensure that all critical patches are applied, and the servers are rebooted if necessary.
Tasks:

    Create a security_patches role:
        Check for available security updates on the target servers.
        Apply all critical security updates.
        Reboot the server if any updates require a restart.

    Create a notification role:
        Send a notification (e.g., email, Slack) after patching is complete.
        Include information about the updates applied and whether a reboot was performed.

    Create a playbook that applies the security_patches role to all servers and uses the notification role to send a summary report.

Goals:

    Ensure that all critical security patches are applied across the infrastructure.
    Verify that notifications are sent with accurate details about the patching process.

Configuration 5: Database Backup and Restoration Automation
Scenario:

Your organization needs to implement an automated solution for backing up and restoring databases. The backups should be stored securely, and restoration should be automated for disaster recovery purposes.
Tasks:

    Create a backup role:
        Identify the database to be backed up (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
        Automate the backup process, storing the backups securely (e.g., encrypting and transferring to a remote server or S3 bucket).
        Implement rotation to keep a defined number of backups.

    Create a restore role:
        Automate the restoration process from the latest backup.
        Ensure that the restoration can be triggered manually or automatically in the event of a failure.

    Create a playbook that performs regular backups using the backup role and can trigger a restoration using the restore role.

Goals:

    Verify that backups are performed according to the schedule.
    Test the restoration process to ensure that the database can be restored from a backup.

Summary

These exercises cover a range of enterprise-level tasks that involve setting up complex environments, automating critical processes, and ensuring that configurations are managed consistently across servers. By working through these, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to use Ansible roles to tackle real-world configuration problems in a large-scale environment.

Configuration 6: Proxy Server Configuration
Scenario:

Your enterprise requires a centralized proxy server to control and monitor outbound traffic from internal servers to the internet. The proxy server should be configured to enforce access control, log all traffic, and provide caching to improve performance.
Tasks:

    Create a squid_proxy role:
        Install Squid on the designated proxy server.
        Configure Squid to allow access only from specific internal networks.
        Set up ACLs (Access Control Lists) to restrict access to certain domains or IP ranges.
        Enable caching to improve performance for frequently accessed websites.
        Configure Squid to log all HTTP traffic for monitoring purposes.

    Create a client_proxy role:
        Configure internal servers to route their traffic through the Squid proxy server.
        Apply the proxy configuration to different environments (development, testing, production) with environment-specific settings.

    Create a playbook that uses the squid_proxy role to configure the proxy server and the client_proxy role to set up the proxy settings on the internal servers.

Goals:

    Verify that internal servers can only access the internet through the proxy server.
    Ensure that Squid's access controls are working correctly and that traffic is logged and cached.
    Test the environment-specific configurations to ensure they are applied correctly.

Configuration 7: Dynamic Configuration with Templating
Scenario:

Your organization needs to deploy applications across multiple environments (development, testing, production). Each environment has different configuration requirements, such as different database connection strings, API keys, and feature flags. You need to create dynamic configuration files that adapt based on the environment in which they are deployed.
Tasks:

    Create an app_config role:
        Use Jinja2 templates to create configuration files for the application.
        The configuration files should dynamically adapt based on variables such as environment, database credentials, API keys, and feature flags.
        Store environment-specific variables in the vars/ directory of the role, with separate files for each environment (e.g., dev.yml, test.yml, prod.yml).

    Create environment-specific playbooks:
        Create separate playbooks for each environment (development, testing, production).
        Each playbook should include the app_config role and pass the appropriate environment-specific variables.

    Create a test playbook:
        Simulate deploying the application in all three environments.
        Use the app_config role to generate the configuration files and verify that they are correctly tailored to each environment.

Goals:

    Ensure that the configuration files are correctly generated with environment-specific values.
    Verify that sensitive information like database credentials and API keys are correctly handled and not hard-coded in the templates.
    Test the deployment across all environments to ensure the configurations work as expected.

Summary

These two exercises focus on setting up a proxy server and using templating to manage environment-specific configurations. The proxy server exercise will help you understand how to centralize and control outbound traffic, while the templating exercise will give you hands-on experience in creating dynamic and flexible configuration files that adapt to different deployment scenarios.
